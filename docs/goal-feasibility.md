### I. Questions about Reachability and Possibility:

- **"Is a specific target configuration/state reachable from a given initial state?"**
  - **Feasibility: High.** The `StateSpaceExplorer` performs a BFS-like traversal. After exploration, you can simply check if the `LexicalIndex` of your target state exists within the `totalNodes` count from `explorer.getStats()`, or explicitly check `stateGraph.getNode(targetIndex)`. To get the path, you would need to implement a BFS path reconstruction (e.g., storing parent pointers during exploration or re-traversing the edges).
- **"Which states are reachable within 'X' number of steps (transitions)?"**
  - **Feasibility: High.** The `exploreBreadthFirst` method already performs a level-by-level exploration. You would need to capture states at specific depths during this process. The `StateGraph` internally knows which nodes are at which depth from the start node of exploration.
- **"Are there any 'dead-end' states...?"**
  - **Feasibility: High.** After exploration, you can iterate through all `GraphNode`s in the `StateGraph` (`stateGraph.getAllNodes()`) and check if `stateGraph.getEdgesFrom(node.index)` returns an empty array.
- **"Are all defined 'goal states' actually reachable...?"**
  - **Feasibility: High.** Define your goal states' `LexicalIndex` values. After exploration, check if all these goal indices exist in the set of `totalNodes` discovered by the `StateSpaceExplorer`.

### II. Questions about Optimality and Efficiency (Sequencing):

- **"What is the shortest (minimum steps) sequence of transitions...?"**
  - **Feasibility: High (for unweighted paths).** BFS naturally finds the shortest path in terms of the number of transitions. The current `StateSpaceExplorer` performs BFS. You would need to add functionality to either:
    1.  Store parent pointers (`{ childIndex: parentIndex }`) during the BFS traversal.
    2.  Or, more complex, re-traverse the `StateGraph`'s edges backwards from the target to the source once the target is found.
- **"What are all the sequences (paths) to reach a target state within a certain number of steps?"**
  - **Feasibility: Moderate.** The `StateGraph` holds all the necessary edges. You would need to implement a pathfinding algorithm that enumerates all paths, possibly using a modified DFS that prunes branches exceeding the step limit. This is not built-in but entirely feasible with the current graph structure.
- **"If transitions have associated costs..., what is the lowest-cost sequence...?"**
  - **Feasibility: Moderate (requires modification).** The current `StateTransition` interface does _not_ explicitly include a `cost` or `weight` property that would be used by a pathfinding algorithm.
    - **Modification needed:** You would need to add a `cost: number` property to `StateTransition` (or `metadata.cost`).
    - **Algorithm needed:** You would then need to implement Dijkstra's algorithm (or A\* if a heuristic is available) on the `StateGraph`'s data, as BFS only considers unweighted paths.

### III. Questions about System Structure and Behavior Analysis:

- **"How large is the reachable state space...?"**
  - **Feasibility: High.** Directly available from `explorer.getStats().totalNodes` (total unique states discovered).
- **"What are the most frequently used/critical transitions or states...?"**
  - **Feasibility: Moderate.** The `StateGraph` provides `getAllNodes()` and `getAllEdges()`. You would need to implement custom analysis logic on this data (e.g., counting incoming/outgoing edge frequencies for states, or counting occurrences of specific `transitionType`s). The `stats.transitionTypes` already gives counts by type.
- **"Are there any cycles in my system's behavior...?"**
  - **Feasibility: Moderate.** The `StateGraph` stores the cycles implicitly (if a node is revisited during exploration that isn't the root of the current path). You would need to implement a standard graph cycle detection algorithm (e.g., DFS-based algorithm for detecting back edges in a directed graph) on the `StateGraph` data.
- **"How does changing a specific rule... impact the graph?"**
  - **Feasibility: High (requires multiple runs).** You would run the `StateSpaceExplorer` with different `StatespaceConfig` instances and then compare the `getStats()` results or analyze the generated graphs (e.g., node counts, edge counts, average degree) from each run.
- **"What are the average and maximum number of transitions possible from any given state?"**
  - **Feasibility: High.** The `explorer.getStats().averageTransitionsPerNode` provides the average. Maximum could be found by iterating through all nodes in the `StateGraph` and checking `getEdgesFrom(node.index).length`.

### IV. Questions for Debugging, Validation, and Testing:

- **"Are my defined transition rules actually leading to the intended states...?"**
  - **Feasibility: High (manual/programmatic inspection).** You can run small explorations and then examine the `SystemState` of generated nodes and the details of `StateTransition` edges to verify correctness.
- **"Does the system guarantee progress, or can it lead to a deadlock...?"**
  - **Feasibility: High.** You can check for "deadlock" nodes by finding states with no outgoing edges (`stateGraph.getEdgesFrom(index).length === 0`). Verifying "guaranteed progress" might involve more complex properties like ensuring all non-goal states eventually lead to a goal, which can be done through reachability analysis.
- **"How can I generate test cases...?"**
  - **Feasibility: High.** By querying the `StateGraph` for paths that satisfy certain criteria (e.g., paths reaching specific difficult states, or paths with specific transition sequences), you can extract sequences to use as test cases.
- **"How can I programmatically verify the model's generated sequences...?"**
  - **Feasibility: High.** You would translate the model's output sequence into a series of `LexicalIndex` states and then check if this sequence corresponds to a valid path (a series of connected edges) within your generated `StateGraph`.
