## What It Does

This framework helps you model dynamic systems to:

- **Find optimal paths**: Identify shortest routes between states.
- **Detect issues**: Locate dead ends or specific system configurations.
- **Analyze behavior**: Gain insights into system dynamics through automated exploration.

**Current examples demonstrate:**

- **Shopping workflows**: E-commerce state transitions and optimal paths
- **Classic puzzles**: Tower of Hanoi solver with complete state space analysis
- **API modeling**: Frontend/backend communication patterns and data flow
- **Graph exploration**: Combinatorial state space growth and branching analysis
