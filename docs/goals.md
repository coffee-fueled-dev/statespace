These are questions I would like to be able to answer using this system:

### I. Questions about Reachability and Possibility:

1.  **Is a specific target configuration/state reachable from a given initial state?** (e.g., "Can I arrange the items in my warehouse like this, starting from my current layout?")
2.  **Which states are reachable within 'X' number of steps (transitions)?** (e.g., "What are all the possible card hands I could have after 3 draws?")
3.  **Are there any "dead-end" states from which no further valid transitions are possible?** (e.g., "Can my assembly line get stuck in a configuration where no more operations can be performed?")
4.  **Are all defined "goal states" (if any) actually reachable from the initial state?** (e.g., "Is every winning configuration of this puzzle actually solvable from the starting position?")

### II. Questions about Optimality and Efficiency (Sequencing):

1.  **What is the shortest (minimum steps) sequence of transitions to reach a specific target state from a given initial state?** (e.g., "What is the minimum number of moves to clear this specific arrangement of containers?")
2.  **What are all the sequences (paths) to reach a target state within a certain number of steps?**
3.  **If transitions have associated costs (e.g., time, resources), what is the lowest-cost sequence to achieve a goal?** (This would require integrating cost weights into the graph and using Dijkstra's/A\*).
4.  **What is the most efficient sequence of operations to complete a task (e.g., loading a truck, assembling a product)?**

### III. Questions about System Structure and Behavior Analysis:

1.  **How large is the reachable state space for my system with these rules and initial setup?** (e.g., "What is the total number of unique valid arrangements for this card game setup?")
2.  **What are the most frequently used/critical transitions or states within the explored state space?** (e.g., "Are there any 'bottleneck' states that many paths must pass through?")
3.  **Are there any cycles in my system's behavior? If so, what states are involved in these cycles?** (e.g., "Can my workflow get stuck in a loop where tasks endlessly repeat?")
4.  **How does changing a specific rule or the initial configuration impact the size, density, or connectivity of the state graph?** (e.g., "If I add a new loading bay, how does it change the total number of reachable states and the average path length?")
5.  **What are the average and maximum number of transitions possible from any given state?** (Insights into system flexibility).

### IV. Questions for Debugging, Validation, and Testing:

1.  **Are my defined transition rules actually leading to the intended states, or are there unintended pathways?** (e.g., "Does 'drawing a card' really only affect the deck and hand containers as expected?")
2.  **Does the system guarantee progress, or can it lead to a deadlock (a state with no outgoing transitions)?**
3.  **How can I generate test cases that explore diverse paths or reach specific challenging states within my system?** (Useful for software testing or physical system validation).
4.  **If I'm using this as ground truth for an AI/ML model, how can I programmatically verify the model's generated sequences against known optimal paths from my graph?**
